# Gomoku
A five-in-a-row game on terminal written in C.

*** This project is for my C language course. Do not copy it in your own assignment! ***

The user interface uses simply terminal I/O (UTF-8 support required). Compatibility is not guaranteed.

Two modes are implemented in this program (player vs player; player vs computer). Use command line to specify the desired mode.
The AI is not well designed so it will eat up CPU time and produces unideal results. Be aware when you run the PvC mode!
